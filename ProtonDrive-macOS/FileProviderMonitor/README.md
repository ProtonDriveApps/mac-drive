Run `./run.sh` to display an icon indicating the status of the file provider in the status bar:

* ðŸ”µ Launching
* ðŸŸ¢ All good (fileprovider is running correctly, there's just one, and it's the correct one)
* ðŸŸ  Fileprovider not running.
* ðŸ”´ Something is wrong (no fileprovider, wrong fileprovider, too many fileproviders, or app not running)

Note: if the status icon disappears because you don't have enough space in the status bar, you can cmd+click it and drag it to the right.
